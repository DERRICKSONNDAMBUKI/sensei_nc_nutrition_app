Cardiovascular disease,"A general term that encompasses diseases of the heart and blood vessels, is the leading cause of death. Coronary heart disease (CHD), also known as coronary artery disease or ischemic heart disease, is the most common and the most deadly form of cardiovascular disease. CHD occurs when the arteries carrying blood to the heart, and thereby oxygen and nutrients, become narrow and obstructed. If blood flow is interrupted in the coronary arteries surrounding the heart, a myocardial infarction (heart attack) may occur. Restriction of blood flow to the brain due to a blood clot or hemorrhage may lead to a cerebrovascular accident, or stroke, and narrowing in the abdominal aorta, its major branches, or arteries of the legs may result in peripheral arterial disease. Most are caused not by total blockage of the arteries by plaque but by blood clots that form more readily where small plaques are already partially blocking the arteries. Drug therapy may include cholesterol-lowering drugs such as statins, bile acid sequestrants, and niacin, as well as aspirin or anticoagulants to prevent formation of blood clots and antihypertensive medication to lower blood pressure.

Hypertension,"It is an important risk factor for other diseases, such as coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, stroke, aneurysm, and kidney disease. Mostly caused by modifiable factors such as excess weight, physical inactivity, high alcohol intake, and diets high in salt.","Low sodium, fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products"
Cancer,"The risk for most cancers is largely related to environmental factors. Most cancer-causing substances (carcinogens) probably enter the body through the alimentary canal in food and beverages. High intake of dietary fat may promote cancer, but this could be due at least in part to the extra energy (calories) that fat provides. Obesity is associated with several types of cancer, including colorectal, prostate, uterine, pancreatic, and breast cancers. A possible mechanism for this effect is the higher circulating levels of estrogen, insulin, and other hormones that accompany increased body fat. Foods also contain substances that offer some protection against cancer. For example, fresh fruits and vegetables, and specifically vitamins C and E, eaten at the same time as nitrate-containing foods.  Vitamin C, vitamin E, carotenoids such as beta-carotene (a plant precursor of vitamin A), and the trace mineral selenium act in the body’s antioxidant systems to help prevent DNA damage by reactive molecules known as free radicals.","Low calories, low fats, fruits and vegetables"
Colorectal cancer,"Consumption of meat, particularly red meat and processed meat, is associated with a modest increase in risk of colorectal cancer. Although fibre-rich foods also appear to be protective against colorectal cancer in many studies, attempts to demonstrate a specific protective effect of dietary fibre, distinct from the nonfibre constituents of vegetables and fruits, have been inconclusive. Obesity is an important risk factor for colorectal cancer in men and premenopausal women, and mild or moderate physical activity is strongly associated with a decreased risk of colon cancer.","Rich fibre, fruits and vegetables"
Prostate cancer,"There is a growing body of evidence that a diet low in fat and animal products and rich in fruits and vegetables, including the cruciferous type, is protective against prostate cancer. Lower prostate cancer risk has been associated with the consumption of tomatoes and tomato products, which are rich sources of the carotenoid antioxidant lycopene.","Tomatoes, low fats, fruits, vegetables, rich fibre, rich vitamin E and selenium."
Diabetes mellitus and metabolic disorders,"Diabetes mellitus is a group of metabolic disorders of carbohydrate metabolism characterized by high blood glucose levels (hyperglycemia) and usually resulting from insufficient production of the hormone insulin (type 1 diabetes) or an ineffective response of cells to insulin (type 2 diabetes). Diabetes is an important risk factor for cardiovascular disease, as well as a leading cause of adult blindness. Other long-term complications include kidney failure, nerve damage, and lower limb amputation due to impaired circulation. Although elevated blood sugar is an important feature of diabetes, sugar or carbohydrate in the diet is not the cause of the disease. Weight loss often helps to normalize blood glucose regulation, and oral antidiabetic agents may also be used. The therapeutic diet, which has changed considerably over the years, focuses on complex carbohydrates, dietary fibre (particularly the soluble type), and regulated proportions of carbohydrate, protein, and fat. The simple sugars formed from digestion of some starchy foods, such as bread or potatoes, are absorbed more quickly and cause a faster rise in blood glucose than does table sugar (sucrose), fruit, or milk","Low fats, rich fibre, low carbohydrates"
Obesity and overweight weight,"Obesity (excess body fat for stature) contributes to adverse health consequences such as high blood pressure, blood lipid abnormalities, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, ischemic stroke, type 2 diabetes, gallbladder disease, osteoarthritis, several common cancers (including colorectal, uterine, and postmenopausal breast cancers), and reduced life expectancy. Environmental factors such as calorie-rich diets and a sedentary lifestyle can be instrumental in determining how an individual’s genetic heritage in obesity will unfold. What matters in weight control is the ratio of food energy (calories) consumed to energy expended, over time. Dietary carbohydrates are not the problem in obesity. The WHO recommend international adoption of the definition of a healthy BMI for adult women and men as between 18.5 and 24.9. A BMI lower than 18.5 is considered underweight, while a BMI of 25 to 29.9 denotes overweight and 30 or higher indicates obesity.  healthful eating plan for gradual weight loss in adults will likely contain about 1,200 to 1,500 kilocalories (kcal) per day, probably accompanied by a balanced vitamin and mineral supplement.","Low calories energy, low fats, fruits and vegetables."
Underweight or eating disorders such as Anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa,"Eating disorders such as anorexia nervosa and bulimia nervosa are serious health problems reflecting an undue concern with body weight. A BMI lower than 18.5 is considered underweight. Anorexia nervosa is characterized by low body weight, propensity for drastic undereating, intense fear of gaining weight or becoming fat (despite being underweight), and a distorted body image. Consequences of underweight include impaired immunity, anemia, and diminished digestive function. Without intervention, a state of semi-starvation similar to marasmus may occur, requiring hospitalization and even force-feeding to prevent death. In bulimia nervosa recurrent episodes of “binge eating” are followed by a form of purging, such as self-induced vomiting, fasting, excessive exercise, or the use of laxatives, enemas, or diuretics. Treatment usually involves a structured eating plan to increase weight. Intense training among young female athletes, coupled with food energy restriction, often results in amenorrhea (failure to menstruate for at least three consecutive months) and bone loss similar to that at menopause. Calcium supplementation may be required.","Normal and rich calories energy, rich calcium"
Dental carries (Tooth decay),"Dental caries (tooth decay) is an oral infectious disease in which bacteria, primarily Streptococcus mutans, in the dental plaque metabolize simple sugars and other fermentable carbohydrates into acids that dissolve tooth enamel. All dietary forms of sugar, including honey, molasses, brown sugar, and corn syrup, can cause tooth decay; fermentable carbohydrates in crackers, breads, cereals, and other grain products, as well as milk, fruits, and fruit juices, also have cariogenic (decay-causing) potential. Putting an infant to sleep with a bottle, especially one containing juice or other sweetened beverages, milk, or infant formula can lead to a condition called “baby bottle tooth decay.” Brewed tea, flouridated water marine fish consumed with bones, and seaweed are significant food sources of fluoride.  Gum health also depends on a properly functioning immune system and good overall nutrition. Key nutrients include vitamin C, which helps protect against gingivitis (inflamed gums), and calcium and vitamin D, which help ensure a strong jawbone and teeth.","Low sugar and sweet food group, Vitamin C,rich calcium and vitamin D"
Bowel conditions and dieseases,"Constipation, a condition characterized by the difficult passage of relatively dry, hardened feces, may arise from insufficient dietary fibre (roughage) or other dietary factors, such as taking calcium or iron supplements, in addition to daily routines that preclude relaxation. Another possible consequence of straining is hemorrhoids, swollen veins of the rectum and anus that typically lead to pain, itching, and bleeding. Constipation can usually be treated by eating high-fibre foods such as whole-grain breads and cereals, drinking sufficient amounts of water, and engaging in regular exercise. In contrast to constipation, diarrhea—loose, watery stools, and possibly an increased frequency of bowel movements—can be a cause for immediate concern. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), such as Crohn disease (regional ileitis) or ulcerative colitis, results in impaired absorption of many nutrients, depending upon which portion of the gastrointestinal tract is affected. Children with IBD may fail to grow properly. Treatment generally includes a diet low in fat and fibre, high in protein and easily digestible carbohydrate, and free of lactose (milk sugar). Increased intakes of certain nutrients, such as iron, calcium, and magnesium, and supplementation with fat-soluble vitamins may also be recommended, along with additional fluid and electrolytes to replace losses due to diarrhea. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a common gastrointestinal disorder characterized by a disturbance in intestinal peristalsis. Symptoms include excessive gas, abdominal discomfort, and cramps, as well as alternating diarrhea and constipation. Although it can be extremely uncomfortable, IBS does not cause intestinal damage. Dietary treatment involves identifying and avoiding “problem” foods, notably legumes and other gas-producing vegetables and dairy products, and possibly reducing caffeine consumption.
