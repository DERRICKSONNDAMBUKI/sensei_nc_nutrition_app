during pregnancy for new maternal and
foetal tissue"
"Crohn’s disease, cystic fibrosis, and certain rare genetic diseases such as abetalipoproteinemia and ataxia ","Nerve and muscle damage that results in loss of feeling in the arms and legs, loss of body movement control, muscle weakness, and vision problems",Vitamin E,"Required for the health of the reproductive system, nerves and muscles, Maintains healthy skin, Acts as an anti-oxidant. help older adults remain mentally alert and active as well as prevent or slow the decline of mental function and Alzheimer’s disease."
Anaemia,bleeding and hemorrhage ,Vitamin K,"Used to manufacture proteins in blood plasma, Responsible for blood clotting, Important for maintaining healthy bone and kidney tissues, Required for synthesis of hormones, Required for the carboxylation of osteocalcin in bone"
Cancers,"Risk of lung cancer, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, pancreatic cancer, oral cavity cancer, laryngeal cancer, esophageal cancer, ovarian cancer, glioma, and bladder cancer",Beta-carotene,"For reproduction (embryonic development,
maintenance of male genital tract and
Spermatogenesis), help prevent cancer or lower the chances of dying of cancer"
Osteoporosis,Development of osteoporosis,Calcium,"Involved in muscle function, nerve transmission, and proper bone formation."
Goitre,"Stunted growth, enlarged thyroid gland, poor growth in infancy and childhood, possible mental retardation, cretinism and neurodevelopmental deficits",Iodine,"A component of thyroid hormones that regulate protein synthesis, metabolism, and enzyme activity."
Iron-deficiency anemia,"Microcytic, hypochromic anemia; impaired cognitive function, poor body temperature regulation, depressed immune function, decreased work output, reduced growth, increased health risk in pregnancy and spoon like shape of nails",Iron,"A component of hemoglobin and therefore important in the transfer of oxygen from the lungs to organs, and involved in the synthesis of hormones as well as normal growth and development."
hypocalcemia or hypokalemia,"Loss of appetite, fatigue, weakness, nausea, vomiting, numbness, tingling, muscle cramps, seizures, personality changes, and abnormal heart rhythms",Magnesium,"Involved in more than 300 enzyme reactions, protein synthesis, muscle function, nerve function, blood sugar control, and blood pressure control."
Stunted growth,"Stunted growth, depressed immune function, hair loss, eye and skin lesions, delayed wound healing, and taste alterations",Zinc,"Involved in cell metabolism, enzyme activity, immune function, protein synthesis, wound healing, DNA synthesis, and cell division."
Hyponatremia (low blood sodium),"Muscle cramps, nausea, dizziness, weakness, and eventually shock and coma",Sodium,"Works with potassium to maintain healthy blood pressure and normal function of nerves and muscles. Works with potassium to maintain water balance and acid-base equilibrium in the body fluids. Vital for muscle sensitivity. Essential for transport of glucose and other nutrients across membranes. Plays a role in the function of the adrenal
gland"
"Hypokalemia, cardiac arrhythmias","Weakness, loss of appetite, muscle cramps, and confusion. Increase blood pressure, kidney stone risk, bone turnover, urinary calcium excretion, and salt sensitivity",Potassium,required for normal cell function because of its role in maintaining intracellular fluid volume and transmembrane electrochemical gradients
"Dehydration (water deficiency), gastroenteritis in children","Thirst, dry mouth, sunken eyes, poor skin turgor, cold hands and feet, weak and rapid pulse, rapid and shallow breathing, confusion, exhaustion, and coma.",Water,"restore fluids lost through metabolism, breathing, sweating, and the removal of waste. It helps to keep you from overheating, lubricates the joints and tissues, maintains healthy skin, and is necessary for proper digestion."
