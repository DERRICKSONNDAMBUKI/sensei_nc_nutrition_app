Mix into a medium soft dough. \nTurn dough onto a flat surface and knead thoroughly until smooth. \nMake a thick long roll, cut into 9 pieces and make the pieces into small balls. \nRoll out the balls, one at a time into desired thickness. \nFlour the surface, slightly oil the top of each rolled-out ball and stack them on top of each other. Continue until all the pieces are placed. \nStitch the edges by poking light holes. \nRoll them out together to one large round piece. \nHeat a shallow pan and toast the rolled dough for 2 minutes per side. If the shallow pan is too small, cut the rolled-out dough to fit. \nToast each side lightly, peeling off each layer after toasting until all the 9 pieces are separated. \nCut triangular shapes on each separated piece; fold each of the triangular pieces into an enve-lope and seal the edges with a preparation of wheat flour paste. \n\nTo make the paste:\n \nThe paste is used to seal the envelopes. \nMix 1⁄4 cup of water and 1⁄2 cup of flour to make a thick paste. \nMake the casings using the paste to bond and seal the edges. \n\nFilling the Samosa:\n \nSpoon the cooled meat filling into the casings and seal off the edges using the paste. \nDo not overfill the casings to prevent it any tears or rips on them. \n\nCooking:\n \nHeat the remaining oil in a deep pan up to 170°C or about 6 minutes or until the oil bubbles when a pinch of dough is dropped in the oil. \nCarefully, deep each samosa into the hot oil and cook while turning until golden brown on both sides. \nRemove from the hot oil making sure to let any excess oil drain back into the pan. \nPlace onto paper towels to drain any excess oil. \nRepeat the process until all the samosas are cooked. \nServe.",

The most common ingredients used in these dishes were a root (such as potatoes or sweet potatoes or cassava), bananas (green or ripe), a green vegetable,maize, and a legume. Different communities have different names for these dishes. For example, Mukimo is common among the Kikuyu and Meru communities, Mushenye among the Luhya communities, Kimanga among the Taita and coastal communities.

Some of the root recipes are almost extinct due to reduced emphasis at crop production level. For instance, the yams and cassava are hardly available at market level which implies reduced cultivation. However, yam dish continues to dominate household meals where this is typical. Roots like arrow roots have seen more utilization as a result of increased emphasis at production level. Irish potatoes are the most abundantly available in Kenya followed by Sweet potato roots. Promotion of the orange fleshed sweet potato has seen increased utilization as a common recipe in most Kenyan communities. [Process photos for recipes in this category will be added in this space]",

Different communities in Kenya traditionally mashed a combined set of ingredients together, perhaps as a coping mechanism or in order to save cooking time. These dishes were also believed to have a rich nutrient base and were eaten without any accompaniment. The most common ingredients used in these dishes were a root (such as potatoes or sweet potatoes or cassava), bananas (green or ripe), a green vegetable,maize, and a legume. Different communities have different names for these dishes. For example, Mukimo is common among the Kikuyu and Meru communities, Mushenye among the Luhya communities, Kimanga among the Taita and coastal communities. Avery common practice across many communities in Kenya is that most infant dishes are made from this category. Infant dishes exclude use of hard ingredients such as maize.
