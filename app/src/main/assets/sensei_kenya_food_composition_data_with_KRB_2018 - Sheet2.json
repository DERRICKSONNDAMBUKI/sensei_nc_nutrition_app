In a bowl, mix a pinch of sugar with the yeast and add the 1⁄4 cup of water used to squeeze the last batch of coconut milk. Stir and set aside for 5 minutes for the yeast to rise. In a separate bowl, mix the dry ingredients; sugar, flour and cardamoms. Add the yeast mixture to the dry ingredients. Add 4 tablespoons of oil and the thick coconut milk into the yeast and dry ingredients mixture. Knead the dough as you add the remaining water to a firm feel. Set the dough aside for 10 minutes for sugar to dissolve. Cover with a cloth. Knead the dough again to mix the sugar and to improve the texture. Cover with a dry cloth and allow to stand for 30 minutes. Divide the dough into small-medium size balls. Set them aside and cover with a dry cloth for 15 minutes. When well raised, roll out each ball into flat discs and cut each into four triangle shaped portions. Heat the remaining oil for 15 minutes to 173°C. Fry the mahamri and turn after 40 seconds. The mahamri will turn golden brown when ready. Remove the first batch of mahamri from oil and place onto paper towels to drain the oil. Continue frying the rest in batches until all are done.

   "Food_preparation_cooking_serves_makes": " Meat Filling: Put the meat in a pan over a fire. Stir continuously. When the juices start oozing out from the meat, cover to cook. Finely chop the leek, coriander and crash the garlic. Mix them together in a bowl. Add salt and chilli to the meat after about 10 minutes. Continue stirring and crushing the meat to prevent it from forming balls. Cook the meat until it dries. Add the leek, garlic and coriander after 4 minutes and stir. Remove from the fire after 1 minute. Let the meat cool before using it to fill the casings. Samosa pocket preparation: Put 2 1⁄2 cups flour in a bowl and add 1 cup cold water. Mix into a medium soft dough. Turn dough onto a flat surface and knead thoroughly until smooth. Make a thick long roll, cut into 9 pieces and make the pieces into small balls. Roll out the balls, one at a time into desired thickness. Flour the surface, slightly oil the top of each rolled-out ball and stack them on top of each other. Continue until all the pieces are placed. Stitch the edges by poking light holes. Roll them out together to one large round piece. Heat a shallow pan and toast the rolled dough for 2 minutes per side. If the shallow pan is too small, cut the rolled-out dough to fit. Toast each side lightly, peeling off each layer after toasting until all the 9 pieces are separated. Cut triangular shapes on each separated piece; fold each of the triangular pieces into an enve-lope and seal the edges with a preparation of wheat flour paste. To make the paste: The paste is used to seal the envelopes. Mix 1⁄4 cup of water and 1⁄2 cup of flour to make a thick paste. Make the casings using the paste to bond and seal the edges. Filling the Samosa: Spoon the cooled meat filling into the casings and seal off the edges using the paste. Do not overfill the casings to prevent it any tears or rips on them. Cooking: Heat the remaining oil in a deep pan up to 170°C or about 6 minutes or until the oil bubbles when a pinch of dough is dropped in the oil. Carefully, deep each samosa into the hot oil and cook while turning until golden brown on both sides. Remove from the hot oil making sure to let any excess oil drain back into the pan. Place onto paper towels to drain any excess oil. Repeat the process until all the samosas are cooked. Serve. ",

Add carrots, stir and cover to cook for 2 minutes. Add cabbage, and stir. Cook for 1 minute. Add salt, stir and cook for 1 minute. Add peas and cook for 1 minute. Remove from heat and let this cool before filling the pockets. Samosa pocket preparation: Put 3 1⁄2 cups of wheat flour in a bowl and add 1 cup of cold water. Mix the ingredients and knead to a soft dough. Divide the dough and roll into medium-sized balls. Lightly dust the rolling surface to prevent the dough from sticking onto the working surface. Flatten the balls and apply a little oil onto the surface of each of the spread dough and stack three pieces together (the oil will help the layers to separate later). Roll out each stack into thin discs. Place a circular plate on the rolled-out dough and trim the edges to form a circle the size of the plate. Place a pan on the fire on high heat for 1 minute. Place the rolled-out dough onto the hot pan and lightly cook each side for 1 minute. Separate each lightly cooked layer (previously placed on top of each other), place into a wide bowl or plate and cover to prevent them from drying. Spread the next batch of stacked discs and cook for 1 minute on each side. To make the paste: The paste is used to seal the envelopes as a bonding agent. Mix 3⁄4 cup of wheat flour and 3⁄4 cup of water to make a paste. Make the casings using the paste to bond and seal the edges. Fold the layers previously covered into 2, cut into half and then into quarters. Take a quarter and fold it into a samosa case and apply the paste to hold the edges together. Repeat this for the rest of the batches. Filling the Samosa: Take each piece and fill in the pocket in the previously prepared vegetables. Use the wheat flour water paste to seal the samosa case. Cooking: Put the remaining oil onto a pan and heat for 17 minutes or until the oil bubbles when a pinch of dough is dropped in the oil. Drop the samosa gently into the oil and cook each side for 2 minutes until golden brown. Remove from the oil and place over kitchen towels to drain any excess oil.",

Different communities in Kenya traditionally mashed a combined set of ingredients together, perhaps as a coping mechanism or in order to save cooking time. These dishes were also believed to have a rich nutrient base and were eaten without any accompaniment. The most common ingredients used in these dishes were a root (such as potatoes or sweet potatoes or cassava), bananas (green or ripe), a green vegetable,maize, and a legume. Different communities have different names for these dishes. For example, Mukimo is common among the Kikuyu and Meru communities, Mushenye among the Luhya communities, Kimanga among the Taita and coastal communities. Avery common practice across many communities in Kenya is that most infant dishes are made from this category. Infant dishes exclude use of hard ingredients such as maize.

Different communities in Kenya traditionally mashed a combined set of ingredients together, perhaps as a coping mechanism or in order to save cooking time. These dishes were also believed to have a rich nutrient base and were eaten without any accompaniment. The most common ingredients used in these dishes were a root (such as potatoes or sweet potatoes or cassava), bananas (green or ripe), a green vegetable,maize, and a legume. Different communities have different names for these dishes. For example, Mukimo is common among the Kikuyu and Meru communities, Mushenye among the Luhya communities, Kimanga among the Taita and coastal communities. Avery common practice across many communities in Kenya is that most infant dishes are made from this category. Infant dishes exclude use of hard ingredients such as maize.
